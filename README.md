# OrderProcessingApp
Solution for Order Processing Application structure is as below.  It has UI, Business and Repository project  but  for the given business senarios there is no use of reposity class , hence it is empty.   Please look only into the UI and Business layer of the project.
Also Each project file has sepearte unit test case projects  but considering unit tetsing of only business logic, the unit test case wriiten only for Business layer projects.  Other two unit test projects are empty for now
